# Example:
# read(uint64_t offset, size_t length, int r) "Reading %llu ~ %u $d" 10 bluestore
#
# You can use basic types
# Use void* for all pointers
# If you want to use non-basic types, the class needs to implement operator string()
#
# Format string:
# The format string isn't strict and doesn't need to be printf-compliant. The
# type specifier is ignored for dout(), it is only used to format the string
# with the right arguments at the right position.
# For LTTng, use %x to print the argument in hexadecimal a format.
#
# Known issues (fixes coming shortly):
# Not possible to print hex with dout
