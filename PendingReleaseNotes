14.0.1
------

* The 'ceph osd rm' command has been deprecated.  Users should use
  'ceph osd destroy' or 'ceph osd purge' (but after first confirming it is
  safe to do so via the 'ceph osd safe-to-destroy' command).
* The mon_health_preluminous_compat and mon_health_preluminous_compat_warning
  config options are removed, as the related functionality is more
  than two versions old.  Any legacy monitoring system expecting Jewel-style
  health output will need to be updated to work with Nautilus.

* Nautilus is not supported on any distros still running upstart so upstart
  specific files and references have been removed.

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> list_missing' command has been renamed to
  'ceph pg <pgid> list_unfound' to better match its behaviour.

* The 'rbd-mirror' daemon can now retrieve remote peer cluster configuration
  secrets from the monitor. To use this feature, the 'rbd-mirror' daemon
  CephX user for the local cluster must use the 'profile rbd-mirror' mon cap.
  The secrets can be set using the 'rbd mirror pool peer add' and
  'rbd mirror pool peer set' actions.

* The `ceph mds deactivate` is fully obsolete and references to it in the docs
  have been removed or clarified.

* The libcephfs bindings added the ceph_select_filesystem function
  for use with multiple filesystems.

* The cephfs python bindings now include mount_root and filesystem_name
  options in the mount() function.

>=13.1.0
--------

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).

* The JSON output of the ``osd find`` command has replaced the ``ip``
  field with an ``addrs`` section to reflect that OSDs may bind to
  multiple addresses.

* CephFS clients without the 's' flag in their authentication capability
  string will no longer be able to create/delete snapshots. To allow
  ``client.foo`` to create/delete snapshots in the ``bar`` directory of
  filesystem ``cephfs_a``, use command:

    - ``ceph auth caps client.foo mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs_a' mds 'allow rw, allow rws path=/bar'``

* The ``osd_heartbeat_addr`` option has been removed as it served no
  (good) purpose: the OSD should always check heartbeats on both the
  public and cluster networks.

* The ``rados`` tool's ``mkpool`` and ``rmpool`` commands have been
  removed because they are redundant; please use the ``ceph osd pool
  create`` and ``ceph osd pool rm`` commands instead.

* The ``auid`` property for cephx users and RADOS pools has been
  removed.  This was an undocumented and partially implemented
  capability that allowed cephx users to map capabilities to RADOS
  pools that they "owned".  Because there are no users we have removed
  this support.  If any cephx capabilities exist in the cluster that
  restrict based on auid then they will no longer parse, and the
  cluster will report a health warning like::

    AUTH_BAD_CAPS 1 auth entities have invalid capabilities
        client.bad osd capability parse failed, stopped at 'allow rwx auid 123' of 'allow rwx auid 123'

  The capability can be adjusted with the ``ceph auth caps`` command. For example,::

    ceph auth caps client.bad osd 'allow rwx pool foo'

* The ``mgr/balancer/max_misplaced`` option has been replaced by a new
  global ``target_max_misplaced_ratio`` option that throttles both
  balancer activity and automated adjustments to ``pgp_num`` (normally as a
  result of ``pg_num`` changes).  If you have customized the balancer module
  option, you will need to adjust your config to set the new global option
  or revert to the default of .05 (5%).


Upgrading from Luminous
-----------------------

* During the upgrade from luminous to nautilus, it will not be possible to create
  a new OSD using a luminous ceph-osd daemon after the monitors have been
  upgraded to nautilus.
